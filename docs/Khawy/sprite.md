# Sprite
Sprites are display objects, they can represent a single image or an animation. After you load the resource you can instance it in your stage by creating a Sprite. The sprite will only be render only if the sprite is a direct or indirect child of stage.
Sprites have position that indicate were they will be draw and scale that sets there size.
The offset moves the image so we can have a diferent translation origin and the pivot sets the origin point were the rotation ans scale will be apply.
Sprites also have a timline that controlls the animation of the sprite.
